          Peer review is the system used to assess the quality of a manuscript
          before it is published. Independent researchers in the relevant
          research area assess submitted manuscripts for originality, validity,
          and significance to help editors determine whether a manuscript should
          be published in their journal. All research articles, and most other
          article types, published in Conference Proceedings undergo peer
          review. This usually involves review by at least two or three
          independent, expert peer reviewers. Individual journals may differ in
          their peer review processes (e.g. open or anonymized), please refer to
          the specific journal for details.
