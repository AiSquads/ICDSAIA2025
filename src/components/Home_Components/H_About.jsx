              In this technological era, numerous digital things are generated,
              by which the amount of data being collected is increasing at an
              unprecedented rate. Accordingly, many emerging related fields like
              big data, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
              and deep learning have been witnessing a paradigm shift in various
              data-driven approaches that tend to evolve new data-driven
              research opportunities in various influential domains like social
              networks, healthcare, information & communication applications and
              so forth.

              Nevertheless, equipping the relevant intelligent functionality
              with data mining and analysis approaches will provide promising
              solutions to many challenging problems by significantly improving
              the service quality and user experience.

              The conference aims at bringing together researchers and
              practitioners in the world working on the applications of Data
              Science and Artificial Intelligence Applications. This conference
              seeks to bring together international researchers to present
              papers and generate discussions in recent trends and developments
              of computing. The conference will feature a range of presentations
              on latest research activities as well as stimulating talks and
              keynote addresses. We are confident that this conference will
              provide a good opening for researchers to share their ideas and
              allow the prospects of future collaborations.

              The 1<sup>st</sup> Conference on Data Science and Artificial
              Intelligence Applications (ICDSAIA-2023) organized by Gobi Arts &
              Science College (Autonomous) at Gobichettipalayam, Erode, Tamil
              Nadu, India. The conference aims at delivering the perspective of
              “Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Applications”, where it
              is focused on research, algorithmic design, data analysis and
              implementation on various real-time applications. (ICDSAIA-2023)
              is primarily devoted to address a comprehensive overview on Data
              Science and Artificial Intelligence Applications for collecting,
              processing, controlling and learning a vast amount of information
              generated across various domains.

              A call is made here inviting researchers and students who are
              involved in the research on Data Science, Agents and Artificial
              Intelligence. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in
              these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate
              theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much of
              this important work is therefore theoretical in nature. However,
              there is nothing as practical as a good theory and some theories
              have indeed made their way into practice.

              Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Data
              Science, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including
              Agents and MultiAgent Systems; this conference intends to
              emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to
              highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these
              areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using Data Science, Agents &
              Artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial applications,
              are welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and
              techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions
              are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited
              in any of the areas listed below.
