                A major part of present Gobichettipalayam was previously known
                as "Veerapandi Gramam", and documents and records still use that
                name. The town was part of the country ruled by king Vēl Pāri,
                who is regarded as one of the Kadai ēzhu vallal (the last seven
                great patrons). Pariyur, a temple town near Gobichettipalayam
                was named after him. The land was later ruled by the Cheras and
                Vijayanagara empire with the town deriving its name after Gobi
                Chetti, a Vijayanagara Polygar. It was captured by Tipu Sultan
                and after Tipu's defeat, British annexed it to their territory.
